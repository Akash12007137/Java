Design a class to represent bank account details as baseclass and bank process as the subclass. The bankdetails class contains the data members like the name of 
the account holder, account number, type of account, balance, and the methods getdetails() and printdetails(). And then create bankprocess class which is the subclass 
of bankdetails class which contains the amount as data member and deposit() and withdraw() two methods. Finally, create an object of the subclass and test it.

class BankDetails {
    protected String name;
    protected long accNum;
    protected String accType;
    protected double balance;

    public BankDetails(String name, long accNum, String accType, double balance) {
        this.name = name;
        this.accNum = accNum;
        this.accType = accType;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void getDetails() {
        System.out.println("Account holder name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Account number: " + accNum);
        System.out.println("Account type: " + accType);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + balance);
    }
}

class BankProcess extends BankDetails {
    public BankProcess(String name, long accNum, String accType, double balance) {
        super(name, accNum, accType, balance);
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("New Balance: " + balance);
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("New Balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankProcess account = new BankProcess("Akash", 123456789, "Savings", 50000);

        account.getDetails();

        double depositAmount = 2000;
        double withdrawalAmount = 1000;

        account.deposit(depositAmount);
        account.withdraw(withdrawalAmount);
    }
}
